## Overview

### Goals

- To implement Softmax function to distinguisch between the numbers in the dataset.
- To implement gradient descent and Newton methods to minimize functions.
- To try different stepwise methods(Powel Wolfe, Armijo, constant) and understand their pros and cons.

### Dataset 

- MNIST dataset

### Model

- **Softmax Regression**: A multi-class logistic regression model using the softmax function.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary logistic regression model for digit classification.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize a function iteratively by adjusting its parameters.
- **Armijo method**: A line search method in optimization that ensures sufficient decrease of the objective function by adjusting the step size iteratively.
- **Powel Wolfe method**: A line search method in optimization that combines the desirable properties of the Powell method for finding a local minimum and the Wolfe conditions for ensuring sufficient decrease and curvature.
